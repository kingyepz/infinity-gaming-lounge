Please add the following prioritized features to the "Gaming Sessions" section of the POS system on Replit:

1. **One-Click Session Report Generation**
   - Implement a feature that allows staff to generate session reports with a single click.
   - Reports should include the following details for each session:
     - Customer name (e.g., "John Doe").
     - Game Station number (e.g., "Game Station 1").
     - Game being played (e.g., "FC25", "GTA 5").
     - Duration of session (in hours or games played).
     - Total cost (calculated based on 40 KES/game or 200 KES/hour).
   - Provide options to generate reports for:
     - Current session.
     - Hourly summary.
     - Daily summary.
   - Ensure the report is displayed in a clear, readable format (e.g., table or list) and can be exported as a text file or printed if possible.
   - Keep the interface simple with a prominent "Generate Report" button on the dashboard.

2. **Customizable Staff Dashboard Widget Layout**
   - Add a customizable dashboard layout where staff can rearrange widgets to suit their workflow.
   - Include the following default widgets:
     - Station Status List (showing "Game Station 1-10" with current customer, game, and status: Available/Occupied).
     - Earnings Overview (total revenue from sessions, updated in real-time).
     - Active Sessions (list of ongoing sessions with timers).
   - Enable staff to drag and drop widgets to reorder them and resize them (e.g., make the Station Status List larger if preferred).
   - Save each staff member's layout preferences (e.g., using a simple user ID or login system) so it persists across sessions.
   - Ensure the customization is intuitive, with a "Save Layout" button and a reset option to default settings.

Please implement these features while maintaining the existing functionality (e.g., "Game Station 1-10", 40 KES/game, 200 KES/hour pricing, customer name, and game input). Prioritize a user-friendly design and test for stability with up to 10 stations. Once completed, provide a brief note on any challenges or additional suggestions for refinement.
