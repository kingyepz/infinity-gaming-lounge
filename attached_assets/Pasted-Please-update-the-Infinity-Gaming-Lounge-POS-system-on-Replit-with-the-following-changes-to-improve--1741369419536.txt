Please update the Infinity Gaming Lounge POS system on Replit with the following changes to improve tab positioning, theming, data visualization, and overall usability, incorporating additional suggestions for responsiveness, hover effects, and charting:

1. **Reorganize Tab Positioning**
   - Remove the redundant top bar tabs ("Overview," "Gaming Sessions," "Customers," "Analytics") to avoid confusion, as the left sidebar should be the primary navigation.
   - Reorder the left sidebar tabs vertically in the following order:
     - POS Dashboard
     - Gaming Sessions
     - Customer Portal (rename "Customers" to "Customer Portal" for consistency)
     - Analytics
     - Reports
   - Ensure the "Gaming Sessions" tab is added back to the left sidebar if missing.
   - Highlight the active tab in the sidebar with a distinct style (e.g., a neon underline or background color).

2. **Apply Welcome Page Theme and Animations**
   - Use the same theme and animations as the welcome page across all tabs, including the sidebar and content areas. This should include:
     - A dark background with neon accents (e.g., purple, green, or blue for buttons, borders, and highlights).
     - A modern font consistent with the welcome page.
     - Animated transitions (e.g., fade-in or slide-in effects) when switching between tabs or loading data, matching the welcome page’s animation style.
   - Ensure the "Start Session" button, input fields, and other interactive elements (e.g., "Generate Report" button) follow this theme (e.g., purple buttons with a glow effect).
   - **Add Hover Effects**: Implement subtle hover effects on sidebar tabs, buttons, and interactive elements (e.g., a neon glow or scale-up animation), matching the welcome page’s style for a cohesive look.

3. **Enhance POS Dashboard with Data Visualization**
   - Update the "POS Dashboard" tab to visualize data using charts for better readability:
     - Active Sessions: Display as a simple number with an icon (e.g., a controller icon) or a small circular progress indicator.
     - Points Earned Today: Use a donut chart to compare today’s points (e.g., 250) to the weekly average.
     - Today’s Revenue: Show a bar graph comparing today’s revenue (e.g., KES 12,500) to the past 7 days, with a label for the percentage change (+15% from yesterday).
     - Top Customers (by points this week): Use a horizontal bar chart to display the top 5 customers (e.g., John Doe - 150 points, Jane Smith - 120 points).
     - Popular Games (most played): Use a donut chart to show the distribution of plays across the top 5 games (e.g., FC25 - 45 plays, GTA 5 - 38 plays).
     - Earnings Trends: Add a line chart for daily, weekly, and monthly earnings, styled with the welcome page’s neon theme.
   - Allow staff to customize the layout of these widgets (drag-and-drop to reorder/resize) and save preferences per user.
   - **Use Chart.js for Charts**: Implement all charts (donuts, bar graphs, line charts) using Chart.js, a lightweight and customizable charting library. Style the charts to match the welcome page theme (e.g., neon colors, dark background, modern font).
   - **Responsive Design**: Ensure the dashboard is responsive across different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, smaller monitors). Adjust chart sizes, collapse widgets, or stack them vertically on smaller screens to maintain usability.

4. **Gaming Sessions Tab**
   - Retain the current functionality for managing "Game Station 1-10".
   - Display each station with:
     - Status (Available/Occupied).
     - Customer Name (input field: "Enter customer name").
     - Game (dropdown: "Select game" with options like FC25, GTA 5, GTA 6, NBA 2K25, F1 Racing, VR Games).
     - Session Type (dropdown: "40 KES/game" or "200 KES/hour").
     - "Start Session" button to initiate the session.
   - Add a timer for active sessions (e.g., "Time: 00:15:32") and an "End Session" button to free up the station.
   - Implement a loyalty points tracker:
     - Award 5 points per 40 KES game and 25 points per 200 KES hour, updating in real-time per customer.
     - Track consecutive games played by the same customer at the same station. If a customer plays 5 games in a row, award a free bonus game (valued at 40 KES) and record it separately from normal games.
     - Display a notification (e.g., "Bonus Game Unlocked!") when the threshold is met, allowing staff to apply it manually or automatically.

5. **Customer Portal Tab**
   - Rename the "Customers" tab to "Customer Portal" for consistency.
   - Include functionality to:
     - Register new customers (name, optional contact details).
     - View/edit customer profiles (e.g., past sessions, total loyalty points earned, history of bonus games earned).
     - Display a searchable list of all registered customers.
   - Add a "Redemptions & Bonuses" subsection:
     - Record all redeemed loyalty points (e.g., points exchanged for free games or hours, with a suggested redemption rate of 100 points = 1 free hour).
     - Log all bonus games earned (e.g., date, customer name, station number) separately from normal games.
     - Allow staff to mark a redemption (e.g., "Redeem 100 points for 1 hour") and update the customer’s points balance.
   - Style this subsection to match the welcome page theme (e.g., neon borders, dark background).

6. **Analytics Tab**
   - Include the following data visualizations using Chart.js:
     - Revenue Trends: Line chart showing revenue over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
     - Loyalty Points: Donut chart showing total points distributed (all-time, monthly, etc.), broken down by games (5 points) and hours (25 points).
     - Top Games: Bar chart of the top 5 games by play count.
     - Top 5 Customers: Horizontal bar chart showing the top 5 customers by sessions, points, or bonus games earned.
     - Bonus Games Usage: A bar chart of total bonus games awarded.
     - Redemptions: A summary of total points redeemed and their value (e.g., free hours/games) in a donut chart.
   - Ensure charts are styled with the welcome page’s neon theme and dark background, and are responsive for different screen sizes.

7. **Reports Tab**
   - Retain the one-click session report generation.
   - Ensure reports include:
     - Customer name, Game Station number, game played, session duration, total cost, and loyalty points earned (5/game or 25/hour).
     - A separate column or section for bonus games earned (e.g., "1 Bonus Game") and points redeemed (e.g., "100 points for 1 hour").
     - Options for current session, hourly summary, and daily summary.
     - Style the table to match the welcome page theme (e.g., neon text, dark background).

Please implement these changes, ensuring the tabs are correctly ordered on the left sidebar, the welcome page’s theme and animations are applied consistently, and the POS Dashboard and Analytics tabs use Chart.js for donuts, bar graphs, and line charts. Add hover effects (e.g., neon glow or scale-up) to sidebar tabs and buttons, and ensure the dashboard is responsive across screen sizes (desktop, tablet, smaller monitors) by adjusting chart sizes or stacking widgets as needed. Prioritize a user-friendly design, test for stability with up to 10 stations, and provide a brief note on any challenges or additional suggestions for refinement.
