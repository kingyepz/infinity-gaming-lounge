see that the Infinity Gaming Lounge system includes a customer portal feature. Looking at the code in client/src/pages/customer/portal.tsx, I can identify some existing features and recommend additional ones that would enhance the customer experience.

Existing Features on the Customer Portal
From the code snippets, I can see the customer portal currently includes:

Gaming History - Shows recent gaming sessions with details like game name, session type, duration, amount paid, and points earned
Loading indicators - Shows when user data or transaction data is loading
User authentication - Access control based on user role
Recommended Customer Portal Features
Based on the project overview and existing code, here are the features that should be on the customer portal:

Profile Dashboard - Display user information, gaming name, and total points
Loyalty Points Management - Show current points, history, and redemption options
Gaming History - Complete list of past gaming sessions
Upcoming Events/Tournaments - Calendar of gaming events
Leaderboards - Show top players and rankings
Game Statistics - Personal performance metrics across different games
Rewards Redemption - Allow customers to redeem loyalty points for rewards
Friend Connect - Add friends and see their gaming activities
Booking System - Reserve gaming stations in advance
Notifications - Updates about promotions, tournaments, and friend activities
Would you like me to implement any of these specific features to enhance the customer portal?
And maybe customer registration and referral (they referred a friend) make get an extra discount and loyalty points?

Based on the provided code, I can see the tabs currently in the dashboard.

For the POS Dashboard (staff view):

Looking at the current Sessions tab, I can suggest several enhancements to make it more functional and user-friendly. Here are my recommendations:

Suggested Additions to the Sessions Tab
Session Filtering & Sorting - Add ability to filter active vs. available stations
Quick Session Stats - Show average session duration, most popular games
Batch Actions - Add ability to end multiple sessions at once
Session Timer Display - Show elapsed time more prominently
Session History - Display recent ended sessions
Search Functionality - Find customers or stations quickly
Let me implement these enhancements:
client/src/pages/pos/dashboard.tsx
These enhancements will make the Sessions tab more functional by adding:

Filtering and sorting options for stations
Quick statistics about active sessions and usage
Session timers with visual progress indicators
Recent session history with detailed information
Batch actions for managing multiple sessions
Search functionality for finding stations or customers
The implementation includes responsive design elements that maintain the existing styling of your application while adding these powerful new features.

Why the word "pos system " floating and obstructing over items on the dashboard layout... can it be removed?without affecting any other functionality and features?
IA

I can see the issue you're describing. The "POS System" text is floating and obstructing other elements in your dashboard layout. This is happening because it's positioned in the sidebar but doesn't integrate well with the rest of the layout. Let's remove it without affecting other functionality.
client/src/pages/pos/dashboard.tsx
This change removes the "POS System" text from the sidebar while preserving the containing div structure to maintain layout spacing. All other functionality remains intact as this is purely a visual change.

I'll help you implement a comprehensive analytics tab with data visualization features for the Infinity Gaming Lounge POS system. Based on your existing code and the server routes, we can create several insightful visualizations.

Let's enhance the analytics tab with revenue charts, user statistics, game popularity metrics, and session data:
client/src/pages/pos/dashboard.tsx
This implementation creates a comprehensive analytics tab with several key visualization components:

Key Metrics Cards:
Total Revenue (Today)
Active Sessions
Most Popular Game
Average Session Time
Revenue Trends Chart:
A 7-day bar chart showing daily revenue trends
Game Popularity Chart:
Bar graph showing the popularity percentage of top games
Hourly Traffic Chart:
Line chart showing traffic patterns throughout the day
Customer Types Breakdown:
Donut chart showing the distribution of customer types (Regular, New, VIP)
The visualizations currently use mock data to demonstrate the UI, but you can replace them with actual data from your API routes as needed. The design follows your gaming lounge's existing aesthetic with dark backgrounds and glowing accents.

For a future enhancement, you could connect these visualizations to real-time data from your server/routes.ts endpoints like /api/reports/hourly and /api/reports/daily.

Airtel Money
All amounts displayed in KES
